## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.
   
   >I used mozillaâ€™s JavaScript references for Math.random() and array functions.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)

   >A challenge that I encountered in creating this project was finding out how to format the logic

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)

   >I often found myself repeating a lot of code in the HTML and CSS, such as buttons.
   I was wondering if there were ways to simplify things to take up less space and make coding more efficient.
   Another question I had was wondering about the fancy websites with graphics and animations.
   I want to know how it's possible for CSS to accomplish this or if there is another tool/language to provide more complex features for websites.
   I also wonder how a website scales UI and other features for different resolutions for monitors and how it scales for mobile devices.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)

   >If I had a few more hours, I would mostly spend time adding additional features and improve the look of the website.
   Instead of a limited amount of patterns, I would like the game to go on forever. There would be a limit to what a person can do and it can be sort of a benchmark.
   I can also add different modes, such as audio only or visual only for clues to increase the difficulty for the player. A
   nother addition can be to add different themes for the website that the user can choose and to add sound effects for winning or losing the game.
